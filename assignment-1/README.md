# 🔥 Assignment 1 - Student CGPA API (Odoo School of Tech)

## 🎓 Student CGPA API

### 📌 Objective

This project is a **REST API built using Express.js** that manages student academic performance records using an **in-memory JSON database**.

The API allows users to:

* Find the topper
* Calculate average CGPA
* Count total students
* Fetch student by ID
* Filter students by branch

---

## 🚀 Features

* RESTful API design
* In-memory JSON data (No database used)
* Static and Dynamic routes
* Proper HTTP status codes
* Clean JSON responses
* Deployed on Render

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* Node.js
* Express.js
* CORS
* Postman (API Testing & Documentation)
